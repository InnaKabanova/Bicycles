## Bicycles
My "reinventions of a bicycle" (aka "reinventions of a wheel") for the sake of tackling different aspects of C++:
* MemoryManagement
   - UniquePtr
   - SharedPtr
   - WeakPtr
   - EnableSharedFromThis
   - MySimpleAllocator (a custom Allocator for an STL container)

All my bicycles are covered by GoogleTest ('UnitTests' sub-project). 

## Examples
Code examples:
* Usage of my self-written UniquePtr
* Usage of a custom Allocator for an STL container
